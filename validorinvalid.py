#write valid and invalid in front of the below variable names and give reason if variable name is invalid
#if = 5 (if is a reserved key word so reserved word cannot use to declare variable)
#123abc = 20(It is invalid because we cannot use number as a varible but we can use both letters and numbers to declare variable which is start with letters)
#$fff = 10(specific character are not use for declaration of variable so it is not valid)
#a12 = 1.25(we can use both letters and numbers to declare variable and variable name is start with letters. it is valid)
#a v = "33ff(we can use underscore instead of space to declare variable so that it is not valid)
#only a12 is valid others are invalid showing the result invalid syntax
a12=5
